## Description
This project is a readme generator that will help developers to focus more of their time on coding and less of their time on generating a formatted readme.  As I am moving through the Rutgers Full Stack Web, these weekly challenges are becoming a lot easier, but I still learned a lot through completing this challenge.  I was granted the opportunity to work with template literals, making my code much more efficient.  This was my first command line application, so that is also a major skill this challenge has helped me to gain.

## Installation
Clone the command-line-readme repository to your local environment and create a new branch or fork the repo.  

## Usage
This application is invoked using node index.js in the terminal and  it creates the readme based off of your answers to the prompts.

## Credits
I used code from class lessons, Rutgers tutors, and class office hours to help finish this project.

## How to Contribute
Someone can contribute by adding extra features or finding and resolving any possible bugs.  I would also like to add a function to intake credit links from the user to be formatted and placed in the readme.
